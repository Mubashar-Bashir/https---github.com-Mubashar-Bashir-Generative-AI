# SPEC-1: Web-Based Task Management Application

## Background

The organization currently relies on a manual, physical file-based system for task assignment and tracking. This process is time-consuming and lacks transparency, making it difficult for supervisors and super users to accurately monitor IT team performance. The IT team is scattered across various projects, leading to challenges in focused work and task visibility. Multiple supervisors are often unaware of the assignments the IT team is working on, resulting in inefficiencies and miscommunications. This web-based task management application aims to digitize the task management process, providing a centralized platform to track task assignments, performance, and progress in real-time. This application will enhance visibility, accountability, and efficiency within the organization.

## Requirements

### Must Have
- User Authentication and Authorization using OAuth with Python
- Role-based access control for Super Users, Supervisors, and Teams
- Task creation, assignment, and management functionalities
- Task status updates and tracking across different phases (TI, TC, TA, TF, TL, TQ)
- Comments and queries on tasks for clarification
- Task approval and rejection workflow
- User profile management
- Task performance and progress visibility for Supervisors and Super Users
- Email notifications for task updates and approvals
- Prioritization of tasks (high, medium, low) and setting due dates
- Notifications system for task updates, approvals, and deadlines
- Search and filtering of tasks based on various criteria
- Deadline reminders for upcoming tasks
- Basic reporting on task completion and performance metrics

### Should Have
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Unit and integration tests for ensuring code quality
- Scalability and maintainability considerations in design
- Advanced reporting and analytics on task performance
- Real-time notifications within the application
- Integration with existing project management tools

### Could Have
- Version control for task changes and data recovery
- Offline functionality for viewing and updating tasks
- Enhanced security measures like two-factor authentication and data encryption

### Won't Have
- Additional user roles beyond Super User, Supervisor, and Teams in the initial version

### Reports
- Individual User Performance Report
  - Number of tasks completed
  - Average time taken to complete tasks
  - Number of tasks initiated/created/assigned
  - On-time task completion rate
  - Stars received through feedback
- Team Performance Report
  - Total tasks completed by the team
  - Average team task completion time
  - Breakdown of task completion by individual team members
- Task Status Report
  - Number of tasks in each phase (TI, TC, TA, etc.)
  - Percentage of tasks completed vs. in progress vs. overdue
- Task History Report
  - Track changes made to tasks (who edited, what was changed, when)
  - View comments and queries associated with tasks

### Metrics
- Workload Distribution: Analyze workload distribution across teams and individuals to identify potential bottlenecks or underutilized resources.
- Task Completion Time: Monitor average and individual task completion times to identify areas for improvement or efficiency gains.
- On-Time Completion Rate: Track the percentage of tasks completed within the designated timeframe to assess project health and adherence to deadlines.
- Feedback Analysis: Analyze star ratings and comments to identify user strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities for improvement in the task creation and assignment process.

### Additional Considerations
- Allow users to filter reports by various criteria (date range, user role, team, etc.).
- Generate reports in different formats (e.g., PDF, CSV) for easy export and sharing.
- Include visual representations of data (e.g., charts, graphs) for better comprehension.

## Method

### Architecture Design

The application will be built using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The key components will include:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization using OAuth.
- **Task Management Service**: Manages task creation, assignment, status updates, and approvals.
- **Notification Service**: Manages email notifications and real-time notifications within the application.
- **Reporting Service**: Generates various performance and status reports.
- **Frontend Application**: Provides the user interface for all interactions.

The microservices will communicate via Kafka, ensuring robust and scalable messaging between components.
